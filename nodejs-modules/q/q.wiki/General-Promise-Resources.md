- ["Promises, Promises"](http://www.slideshare.net/domenicdenicola/promises-promises) ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNxnHbyzhuo)) introduces promises from the ground up, gives an overview of the recent history of promises, and provides some guidance on using promises in your real-world code.
- ["Callbacks, Promises, and Coroutines (oh my!)"](http://www.slideshare.net/domenicdenicola/callbacks-promises-and-coroutines-oh-my-the-evolution-of-asynchronicity-in-javascript) is a deep dive into asynchronous programming patterns and practices, including introductory material for those new to asynchronous programming.
- ["Boom! Promises/A+ Was Born"](http://www.slideshare.net/domenicdenicola/boom-promisesa-was-born) explains the Promises/A+ zeitgeist.
- ["Promises and Generators: Control Flow Utopia"](http://pag.forbeslindesay.co.uk/#/) ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbKWsbJ76-s)) steps through a specific example, showing the pitfalls of callback-based solutions and the benefits promises alone can give you, as well as promises plus ES6 generators.
